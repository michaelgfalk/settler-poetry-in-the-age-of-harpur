This paper concentrates on a little-remarked sub-genre of lament for Aboriginal suffering and related poems that appeared in the 1840s, explaining their sudden appearance as partly a result of historical accident and partly of an emerging international taste, in effect a discourse, duly communicated to the colonies. I locate this discourse especially in the influential Leatherstocking Tales of James Fenimore Cooper, who adapted the elegiac Romanticism of Sir Walter Scott, James Macpherson and Thomas Campbell into a new discourse for the lamentation of colonisation. It was this discourse that Australian laments were echoing or addressing and that the most able of the poets (Charles Harpur and Eliza Dunlop) were actively hybridising in some notable and moving contributions. The essay lastly traces a later regression in sympathy as the century wore on, an ideological rigidifying on the part of many writers, but with intriguing exceptions.

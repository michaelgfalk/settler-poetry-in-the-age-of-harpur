No Australian poet was so determined to carry the project of European Romanticism into an antipodean context as Charles Harpur. And yet, despite his earnest endeavours, Harpur was unable to graft Romanticism onto his new situation in any lasting manner. The Colonies’ literary culture famously moved from tidy Neoclassicism to Victorian sentiment without stopping to engage with the Romantics.

My paper asks why Harpur’s efforts failed, and what implications that failure had for our understanding of Romanticism more broadly. If in the hands of one such as Harpur, as Judith Wright has suggested, Wordsworth’s Yeoman plainness was an ideal poetic vehicle to establish some local version of Romanticism, why did the project die with him?

Paul Kane has written that ‘to read \[Harpur’s\] collected poems is to finish, finally, with the indelible impression that this is a major figure but a minor poet.’ What if Harpur’s failure to attain the Romantic sublime has as much to do with Australia and Australian sublimity (his ‘evergreen muse’) as the poet’s own shortcomings?

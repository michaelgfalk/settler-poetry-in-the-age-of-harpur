Charles Harpur’s epic, *The Witch of Hebron* (1867), constitutes his most sustained engagement with Biblical tradition and Jewish identity. The poem describes the meeting of a Rabbi with the ‘Witch of Hebron’, a character of Harpur’s invention who experiences a series of metamorphoses after making a pact with the devil. In this paper, we analyse Harpur’s poem as part of the longer tradition of Jewish naturalisation in English literature. Harpur himself had attempted to enter this tradition in his early career, when he attempted a tragic drama on King Saul (c. 1838), which was intended to include a representation of the Biblical ‘Witch of Endor’. How does the invented ‘witch’ of his late epic fit into this tradition? What is the significance of the central characters’ Jewish identities in the poem? We answer such questions under the three heads of civil religion, secularism, and toleration, revealing how Harpur uses Jewish material in *The Witch of Hebron* to revise the radical settler republicanism of his youth.

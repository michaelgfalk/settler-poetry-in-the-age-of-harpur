title: "'One Mighty Stream of Soul': Charles Harpur and Chaucerian Medievalism"

Charles Harpur was not alone among nineteenth-century writers to look with affection and admiration on the poetry of Geoffrey Chaucer. Harpur’s poem, “Chaucer” and his essay on the poet, sit in comfortable generic affiliation with the writings of Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Hunt, and others, on the medieval poet, though their opinions on the quality and import of Chaucer’s writings often differ. There are other references to Chaucer in early Australian writing, but Harpur’s is the most sustained expression of settler Chaucerianism in the nineteenth century. This paper analyses Harpur’s two “Chaucerian” texts, and his analysis of Chaucer’s prosody, semantics, sensibility, style, and spirit, showing how the Australian poet situates himself carefully in the long English tradition of praise for Chaucer, while also affirming his own critical, temporal, and cultural distance from the poet.
